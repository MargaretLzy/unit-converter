2.2 Product Functions

	Summarize the major functions the product must perform or must let the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 3, so only a high level summary (such as a bullet list) is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the SRS. A picture of the major groups of related requirements and how they relate, such as a top level data flow diagram or object class diagram, is often effective.
	And in Section 3, donâ€™t address all the subsections. Just describe the specification in English and point  make sure that you read the contents of each section which are filled with information that would typically go in there.


This product converts measurements from the imperial system to the metric system and vice versa. As of 4 December 2018, it will convert distance, area, volume, and temperature.
