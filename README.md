This is our final Project for CS-203. It is a unit converter. We will do most relevant conversions from Imperial System to Metric System, such as distance and volume. We may also do inter-unit conversions like feet-->inches.

For now, let's start small, quality over quantity. We can discuss it more. Let's start with:
- feet to meters
- cups to liters

Notes:
- PizzaFactory format
- different types of Conversions (PizzaFactory)
- dialog with user to retrieve input 
=======
Potential design decisions
- classes for number, interface, and caluculator
- user navigates menu/dialogue boxes to input data
- seperate factories for length, volume, mass...
